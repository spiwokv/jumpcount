## Estimation of uncertainties of molecular simulations

The free energy difference ΔG<sub>0</sub> between two states can be calculated by
a molecular dynamics simulation from time spent in both states. Here we
provide an online tool to calculate errorbars of ΔG<sub>0</sub> by the JumpCount
method solely from numbers of transitions and temperature.
