##Estimation of uncertainties of molecular simulations

The free energy difference ΔG_0 between two states can be calculated by
a molecular dynamics simulation from time spent in both states. Here we
provide an online tool to calculate errorbars of ΔG_0 by the JumpCount
method solely from numbers of transitions and temperature.
